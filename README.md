# Project 4 - TDD

Project 4 is all about Test Driven Development (TDD).  This is the practice where you write your unit tests ***before*** writing any of your implementation code.

You can read more about TDD at [https://www.guru99.com/test-driven-development.html](https://www.guru99.com/test-driven-development.html)

###### Instructions
Complete project 4 by doing the following:
1. Fork the template for this project from [https://github.com/UltimateSandbox/project-4-initial.git](https://github.com/UltimateSandbox/project-4-initial.git)
2. Clone the template from your repo into your local system using the IDE.
3. In the **GentlyDownTheStream** class, read the TODO comment at the top of each method.
4. Go to the corresponding test in the **GentlyDownTheStreamTest** class and look at the code implemented for the *expected* value.
5. Use this code to update/write the implementing code in the *GentlyDownTheStream* class for that specific method.
6. You have 9 methods to complete - the first one is done for you already.
7. Each of the methods in the *GentlyDownTheStream* class can be implemented with a single return statement - use the first method as an example.
8. You are complete once all 10 of your unit tests pass.
9. Any questions, let me know!
